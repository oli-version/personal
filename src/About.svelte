    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>One day I randomly decided that I wanted to learn 
        HTML, so I searched <code>HTML tutorial</code> <br> on
         Youtube, and I found a video by <a {target}
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE">
          Traversey Media</a> and it was a 1 hour long crash <br> 
          course on HTML. From then on I just kept on practicing and from trial-and-error, <br> I have learned more and more, and now I'm using svelte.</p>
